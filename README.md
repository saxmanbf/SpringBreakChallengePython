# SpringBreakChallengePython
a program to encode a message using a square cypher. This project is a five test compilation. 1st: Normalizes a given input text 2nd: Takes the text and divides it up into even chunks of "words" that could be used to form a square or rectangle of text. Each "word" forming one row. 3rd: Adds temporary puncuation characters to the last array element in order to make all elements equal in length. This avoids 'index out of range' errors in the next step. 4th: Takes the chunks or "words" and encrypts them, transforming the columns into rows. If you read the seperate chunks, the new chunks that are formed are formed using the first letter of each chunk to form a new chunk, the second letter of each chunk to form a new chunk, and so on. 5th: Combines all the functions into one callable function to fully encrypt the input message.

This program can be used to send hidden messages to whoever you need to send hidden messages to. This is also a program that exemplifies a lot of different ways that you can manipulate given text in python. The functions used throughout the program include a lot of the fundamental functions that individuals new to python will need to familiarize themselves with.
